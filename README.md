# Satellite Viewer

This is an example app showing you how to create a satellite tracker from scratch in JavaScript. [See the full guide here](https://dev.to/omar4ur/create-a-satellite-tracker-from-scratch-in-30-lines-of-javascript-32gk).

* **index.html** shows you how to construct satellite positions over time from the source TLE's and visualize it on the globe.
* **simple.html** is a simplified version that only loads a single position in time. It shows where the satellite currently is when the page was refreshed.
* **street-level.html** is a more complex example showing how to place the camera at a street view in Melbourne, Australia, to see how the buildings at that location obscure the view to the satellite.
